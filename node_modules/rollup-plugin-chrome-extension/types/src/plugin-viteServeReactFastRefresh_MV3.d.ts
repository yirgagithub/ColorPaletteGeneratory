/**
 * @vitejs/plugin-react adds a Fast Refresh prelude to HTML pages as an inline script.
 * The prelude must run before any React code. An inline script guarantees this.
 *
 * The Chrome Extension default CSP blocks inline script tags.
 *
 * In MV3, we can't add a hash to the CSP. Instead, we wrap all
 * JSX and TSX script tags with a dynamic import that delays until the prelude is done.
 * We add a script to the prelude that signals the other scripts when it is done.
 *
 * This will require users to observe a convention:
 *
 * All scripts that expect to use React Fast Refresh
 * must use the JSX or TSX extension.
