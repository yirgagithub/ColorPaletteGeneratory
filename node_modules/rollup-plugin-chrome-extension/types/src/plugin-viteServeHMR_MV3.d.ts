/**
 * The Chrome Extension default CSP blocks remote code.
 * Vite's version of HMR relies on network requests and module caching.
 * We need to get our HTML scripts from localhost.
 *
 * Officially, MV3 allows us to relax the CSP during development,
 * but due to a bug Chromium ignores the CSP in the manifest:
 * https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1247690#c_ts1631117342
 *
 * Strategy: A CSP isn't designed to defend against yourself, only outside actors.
 * We can use the MV3 service worker to circumvent the MV3 CSP using a fetch handler.
